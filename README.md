# City Service Database
This project lets you work with a MySQL database to create, retrieve, update, and delete city services within a city district. Available database entities that can be worked with are: fire stations, police stations, schools, and social services.

See pdf called "Entities, ERD, and Schema" for more details about the database design.

Project done for my database class with a classmate (who made the wonderful UI).
